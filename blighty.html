<h1 id='angles' class="tribes">Anglomania</h1>
<h2 class ='barbs' > Englishmen</h2>
<p>The most advanced people in the world. It's flabberghasting to believe that they are the tribals from 
    europe.

<h2 class='loot' > Great Brits</h2>
<p> You know what ! British ruled one-quarter of the world. In contemporary world it seems quite daunting to establish
    a business and to run it prosperously, but centuries ago how englishmen have ruled the world ?
